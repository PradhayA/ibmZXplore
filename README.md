# Welcome to IBM Z Xplore Learning Platform! 🚀

Hey there! I'm Pradhay, an IBM Z Student Ambassador, and I'm super excited to share some amazing stuff about the IBM Z Xplore Learning Platform.

## What's IBM Z Xplore? 🤔

IBM Z Xplore is a fantastic learning platform that's free for everyone. You don't need any prior knowledge to dive in. It's all about getting hands-on experience with IBM Z skills. Did you know that enterprise computing, which IBM Z is a part of, powers 68% of all worldwide transactions? That's mind-blowing!

## Why should you care? 🎯

- **Learners**: This is your golden ticket to gain some serious enterprise computing skills, improve your career prospects, and earn badges. Yes, badges! More on that later.
- **Educators**: You get access to graded, turnkey, hands-on projects and other resources for your class. It's a win-win!
- **Employers**: You can upskill or reskill your employees or hire new candidates to close the skills gap.

## The Badge System 🏅

One of the coolest parts of IBM Z Xplore is the badge system. As you progress through the platform, by completing modules, you can earn badges that showcase your skills and achievements. Here are three levels:

- **IBM Z Xplore Concepts Badge**: This is your first step. It shows you've got the basics down and understand IBM Z concepts.
- **IBM Z Xplore Advanced Badge**: This is the next level. It shows you can solve advanced IBM Z problems and work with tools like Ansible and Zowe.
- **IBM Z Xplore Code-a-Thon Achiever**: This is for those who have completed a self-paced code-a-thon with challenges designed to experience modern ways of working on a mainframe.

## My Experience 🎓

I've recently completed my Fundamentals and Concepts badges, and the journey has been nothing short of amazing. Diving into the world of IBM Z, I've learned so much about enterprise computing. I started with the basics, understanding the architecture and hardware of mainframes, the backbone of today's digital economy.

As I progressed, I got hands-on experience with JCL (Job Control Language) and REXX, scripting languages used for job scheduling and automation on IBM Z.

But it wasn't just about the technical skills. The platform also taught me about problem-solving and critical thinking. I learned how to approach complex problems, break them down, and find effective solutions. I also learned about the importance of collaboration and communication in a tech environment.

The best part? All this learning was done through practical, hands-on challenges. It wasn't just theory; I was applying what I learned in real-world scenarios. This practical approach has helped me understand the concepts better and has given me confidence in my skills.

And now, having earned the Fundamentals and Concepts badges, I feel ready to take on the Advanced Badge. I'm excited about the journey ahead and the new things I'm going to learn. Here's what you could be getting: https://www.credly.com/badges/82d4a2d3-4ab9-44aa-bb10-c73d25828cfc/public_url.
