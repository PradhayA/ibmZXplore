# Welcome to IBM Z Xplore Learning Platform! 🚀

Hey there! I'm Pradhay, an IBM Z Student Ambassador, and I'm super excited to share some amazing stuff about the IBM Z Xplore Learning Platform.

## What's IBM Z Xplore? 🤔

IBM Z Xplore is a fantastic learning platform that's free for everyone. You don't need any prior knowledge to dive in. It's all about getting hands-on experience with IBM Z skills. Did you know that enterprise computing, which IBM Z is a part of, powers 68% of all worldwide transactions? That's mind-blowing!

## Why should you care? 🎯

- **Learners**: This is your golden ticket to gain some serious enterprise computing skills, improve your career prospects, and earn badges. Yes, badges! More on that later.
- **Educators**: You get access to graded, turnkey, hands-on projects and other resources for your class. It's a win-win!
- **Employers**: You can upskill or reskill your employees or hire new candidates to close the skills gap.

## The Badge System 🏅

One of the coolest parts of IBM Z Xplore is the badge system. As you progress through the platform, by completing modules, you can earn badges that showcase your skills and achievements. Here are three levels:

- **IBM Z Xplore Concepts Badge**: This is your first step. It shows you've got the basics down and understand IBM Z concepts.
- **IBM Z Xplore Advanced Badge**: This is the next level. It shows you can solve advanced IBM Z problems and work with tools like Ansible and Zowe.
- **IBM Z Xplore Code-a-Thon Achiever**: This is for those who have completed a self-paced code-a-thon with challenges designed to experience modern ways of working on a mainframe.
